The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building and spread of\nfire over the outside surface is restricted.\nb. The materials used to construct external walls, and attachments to them, and how they are\nassembled do not contribute to the rate of fire spread up the outside of the building.\nThe extent to which this is necessary depends on the height and use of the building.\nResisting fire spread from one building to another\nThe external envelope of a building should not provide a medium for undue fire spread to\nadjacent buildings or be readily ignited by fires in adjacent buildings. This intention can be met by\nconstructing external walls so that all of the following are satisfied.\na. The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building is restricted.\nb. The amount of thermal radiation that falls on a neighbouring building from window openings\nand other unprotected areas in the building on fire is not enough to start a fire in the other\nbuilding.\nc. Flame spread over the roof and/or fire penetration from external sources through the roof is\nrestricted.\nThe extent to which this is necessary depends on the use of the building and its position in relation\nto adjacent buildings and therefore the site boundary.\n78\nOO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN\nOO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN B4\nSection 10: Resisting fire spread over\nexternal walls\nIntroduction"

In such cases, it will be necessary to demonstrate that a system\nor product can meet the relevant performance classification. This will be achieved if the system or\nproduct complies with one of the following.\na. They should be in accordance with a specification or design that has been shown by a specific\ntest to be capable of meeting that performance classification.\nb. They should have been designed by using relevant design standards in order to meet that\nperformance classification.\nc. They should have been assessed by applying relevant test evidence, in lieu of carrying out a\nspecific test, as being capable of meeting that performance classification.\nNOTE: Some products are subject to Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT). For the\ncapable of meeting a performance specification as per paragraph B1a.\nB2 Any test evidence used to demonstrate the fire performance classification of a product or system\nshould be carefully checked to ensure that it is applicable to the intended use. Small differences\nin detail, such as fixing method, joints, dimensions, the introduction of insulation materials and air\ngaps (ventilated or not), can significantly affect the performance.\nB3 Assessments should not be regarded as a way to avoid a test where one is necessary. Assessments\nshould only be carried out where sufficient relevant test evidence is available. Relevant test\nevidence is unlikely to be provided by test standards which have different classification criteria.\nB4 Where it is proposed to assess the classification of a product or system in lieu of carrying out a\nspecific test (as in paragraph B1c), this should be done in accordance with the relevant standard for\nextended application for the test in question and should include details of the test evidence that\nhas been used to support the assessment.\nFor performance classifications where there is no specific standard for extended application,\nassessment reports should be produced in accordance with the principles of BS EN 15725 and\nshould include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment. Further\ninformation on best practice is provided in the Passive Fire Protection Forum\u2019s Guide to Undertaking\nTechnical Assessments of the Fire Performance of Construction Products Based on Fire Test Evidence.\nNOTE: Regulation 7(2) limits components used in or on the external walls of certain buildings to\nmaterials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 (see Section 10). Assessments cannot be used to\ndemonstrate compliance with this requirement.\n121\nOO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN\nB OO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN\nB5 Tests and assessments should be carried out by organisations with the necessary expertise. For\nexample, organisations listed as \u2018notified bodies\u2019 in accordance with the European Construction\nProducts Regulation or laboratories accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS)\nfor the relevant test standard can be assumed to have the necessary expertise.\nNOTE: Standard fire tests do not directly measure fire hazard. They measure or assess the response\nof a material or system to exposure to one or more aspects of fire conditions. Performance in fire\ntests is only one of a number of factors that should be taken into account.\nReaction to fire\nB6 Reaction to fire relates to the degree to which a product will contribute, by its own\ndecomposition, to a fire under specified conditions. Products, other than floorings, are classified\nas A1, A2, B, C, D, E or F (with class A1 being the highest performance and F being the lowest) in\naccordance with BS EN 13501-1. Class F is assigned when a product fails to attain class E. Untested\nproducts cannot be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-1.\nMaterials covered by the Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT) process can be found by\naccessing the European Commission\u2019s website https://eur-lex.europa.eu/.\nB7 The classes of reaction to fire performance of A2, B, C, D and E are accompanied by additional\nclassifications related to the production of smoke (s1, s2, s3), with s1 indicating the lowest\nproduction, and/or flaming droplets/particles (d0, d1, d2), with d0 indicating the lowest\nproduction.\nNOTE: When a classification includes s3, d2 this means that there is no limit set for smoke\nproduction and/or flaming droplets/particles.\nB8 To reduce the testing burden on manufacturers, BS EN 13238 defines a number of standard\nsubstrates that produce test results representative of different end use applications. The\nclassification for reaction to fire achieved during testing is only valid when the product is used\nwithin this field of application, i.e. when the product is fixed to a substrate of that class in its\nend use. The standard substrate selected for testing should take account of the intended end use\napplications (field of application) of the product and represent end use substrates that have a\ndensity of a minimum of 75% of the standard substrate\u2019s nominal density.\nB9 Standard substrates include gypsum plasterboard (BS EN 520) with a density of 700+/-100kg/m3,\ncalcium silicate board (BS EN 14306) 870+/-50kg/m3 and fibre-cement board 1800+/-200kg/m3.\nNOTE: Standard calcium silicate board is not representative of gypsum plasterboard end use (due\nto the paper layer), but would be representative of most gypsum plasters (with densities of more\nthan 650kg/m3).\nNOTE: Classifications based on tests using a plasterboard substrate would also be acceptable for\nproducts bonded to a gypsum plaster end use substrate.\nNational classifications for reaction to fire\nB10 This document uses the European classification system for reaction to fire set out in BS EN 13501-1;\nhowever, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set\nout in previous editions. Where this is the case, Table B1 can be used for the purposes of this\ndocument.\n122\nOO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN\nOO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN B\nTable B1 Reaction to fire classifications: transposition to national class\nBS EN 13501-1 classification Transposition\nA1 Material that, when tested to BS 476-11, does not either:\na. flame\nb. cause a rise in temperature on either the thermocouple at the centre of the\nspecimen or in the furnaces\nA2-s1, d0 None\nA2-s3, d2 Material that meets either of the following.\na.

If a performance for production of smoke and/or flaming droplets/\nparticles is specified, then only the European classes can be used. For example, a national class may\nnot be used as an alternative to a classification which includes s1, d0.\nThermoplastic materials\nB11 Thermoplastic material is any synthetic polymeric material that has a softening point below 200\u00b0C\nif tested to BS EN ISO 306 Method A120.

Fire resistance is a measure of one or more of the following.\na. Resistance to collapse (loadbearing capacity), which applies to loadbearing elements only,\ndenoted R in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance.\nb. Resistance to fire penetration (integrity), denoted E in the European classification of the\nresistance to fire performance.\nc. Resistance to the transfer of excessive heat (insulation), denoted I in the European\nclassification of the resistance to fire performance.\nB20 The standards of fire resistance necessary for a particular building are based on assumptions about\nthe severity of fires and the consequences should an element fail. Fire severity is estimated in very\nbroad terms from the use of the building (its purpose group), on the assumption that the building\ncontents (which constitute the fire load) are similar for buildings with the same use.\nB21 Because the use of buildings may change, a precise estimate of fire severity based on the fire load\ndue to a particular use may be misleading. Therefore if a fire engineering approach of this kind is\nadopted, the likelihood that the fire load may change in the future needs to be considered.\nB22 Performance in terms of the fire resistance to be achieved by elements of structure, doors and\nother forms of construction is classified in accordance with one of the following.\na. BS EN 13501-2.\nb. BS EN 13501-3.\nc. BS EN 13501-4.\nB23 Fire resistance is measured in minutes. This relates to time elapsed in a standard test and should\nnot be confused with real time.\nB24 The fire resistance necessary for different circumstances is set out in the following tables.\n125\nOO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN\nB OO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN\na.

If one element of structure supports or carries or gives stability to another, the fire resistance\nof the supporting element should be no less than the minimum period of fire resistance for the\nother element (whether that other element is loadbearing or not). In some circumstances, it\nmay be reasonable to vary this principle, for example:\ni. if the supporting structure is in the open air and is not likely to be affected by the fire in\nthe building\nii. if the supporting structure is in a different compartment, with a fire-separating element\n(that has the higher standard of fire resistance) between the supporting and the separated\nstructure\niii. if a plant room on the roof needs greater fire resistance than the elements of structure\nthat support it.\nb. If an element of structure forms part of more than one building or compartment, that element\nshould be constructed to the standard of the higher of the relevant provisions.\nc. If, due to the slope of the ground, one side of a basement is open at ground level (allowing\nsmoke to vent and providing access for firefighting) for elements of structure in that storey\nit may be appropriate to adopt the standard of fire resistance that applies to above-ground\nstructures.\nd. Although most elements of structure in a single storey building may not need fire resistance,\nfire resistance is needed if one of the following applies to the element.\ni. It is part of, or supports, an external wall, and there is provision in the guidance on\nrequirement B4 to limit the extent of openings and other unprotected areas in the wall.\nii. It is part of, or supports, a compartment wall, including a wall that is common to two or\nmore buildings.\niii. It supports a gallery.\nB27 For the purposes of this paragraph, the ground storey of a building that has one or more basement\nstoreys and no upper storeys may be considered as a single storey building.

As determined with reference to Commission Decision 2000/367/EC regarding the\nclassification of the resistance to fire performance of construction products, construction\nworks and parts thereof. All fire doorsets should be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-2,\ntested to the relevant European method from the following.\ni. BS EN 1634-1.\nii. BS EN 1634-2.\niii. BS EN 1634-3.\nc. As determined with reference to European Parliament and Council Directive 95/16/EC (which\napplies to lifts that permanently serve buildings and constructions and specified safety\ncomponents) on the approximation of laws of Member States relating to lifts (\u2018Lifts Directive\u2019)\nimplementing the Lifts Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/831) and calling upon the harmonised standard\nBS EN 81-58.\nC2 The performance requirement is in terms of integrity (E) for a period of minutes. An additional\nclassification of S is used for all doors where restricted smoke leakage at ambient temperatures is\na\nneeded.\nC3 The requirement is for test exposure from each side of the doorset separately. The exception is lift\ndoors, which are tested from the landing side only.\nC4 Any test evidence used to verify the fire resistance rating of a doorset or shutter should be\nchecked to ensure both of the following.\na. It adequately demonstrates compliance.\nb. It is applicable to the complete installed assembly. Small differences in detail may significantly\naffect the rating.\nUntil relevant harmonised product standards are published, for the purposes of meeting the\nBuilding Regulations, products tested in accordance with BS EN 1634-1 (with or without pre-fire test\nmechanical conditioning) that achieve the minimum performance in Table C1 will be deemed to\nsatisfy the provisions.\nC5 All fire doorsets, including to flat entrances and between a dwellinghouse and an integral garage,\nshould be fitted with a self-closing device, except for all of the following.\na. Fire doorsets to cupboards.\nb. Fire doorsets to service ducts normally locked shut.\nc. Fire doorsets within flats and dwellinghouses.\n136\nOO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN\nOO NN LL II NN EE VV EE RR SS II OO NN C\nC6 If a self-closing device would be considered to interfere with the normal approved use of the\nbuilding, self-closing fire doors may be held open by one of the following.\na.

An automatic release mechanism activated by an automatic fire detection and alarm system.\nc. A door closer delay device.\nC7 Two fire doorsets may be fitted in the same opening if each door is capable of closing the opening,\nso the total fire resistance is the sum of their individual resistances. If the opening is provided as a\nmeans of escape, both fire doorsets should be self-closing.\nIf one fire doorset is capable of being easily opened by hand and has a minimum of 30 minutes\u2019 fire\nresistance, the other fire doorset should comply with both of the following.\na. Be fitted with an automatic self-closing device.\nb. Be held open by a fusible link.\nC8 Fire doorsets often do not provide any significant insulation. Unless providing both integrity\nand insulation in accordance with Appendix B, Table B3, a maximum of 25% of the length of a\ncompartment wall should consist of door openings.\nWhere it is practicable to maintain a clear space on both sides of the doorway, the above\npercentage may be greater.\nC9 Rolling shutters should be capable of manual opening and closing for firefighting purposes (see\nSection 15). Rolling shutters across a means of escape should only be released by a heat sensor,\nsuch as a fusible link or electric heat detector, in the immediate vicinity of the door.\nUnless a shutter is also intended to partially descend as part of a boundary to a smoke reservoir,\nshutters across a means of escape should not be closed by smoke detectors or a fire alarm system.\nC10 Unless shown to be satisfactory when tested as part of a fire doorset assembly, the essential\ncomponents of any hinge on which a fire door is hung should be made entirely from materials that\nhave a minimum melting point of 800\u00b0C.\nC11 Except for doorsets listed in paragraph C12, all fire doorsets should be marked with one of the\nfollowing fire safety signs, complying with BS 5499-5, as appropriate.\na.
